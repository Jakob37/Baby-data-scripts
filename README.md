Why baby data? At first I thought I would not need it. But our child struggled with the feeding rhythm. Keeping track of the data helped us better understand his needs. So after being on the fence, I am now for baby data.

I use the app Baby Daybook to track the information. The backup can be exported in SQL format and then the CSV can be easily obtained.
